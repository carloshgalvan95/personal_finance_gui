# Personal Finance GUI - Project Setup Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a personal finance app with a GUI for tracking income, expenses, and financial goals.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Created GitHub repository: `personal_finance_gui`
- [x] Repository URL: https://github.com/carloshgalvan95/personal_finance_gui
- [x] Initial project structure with README.md and .gitignore
- [x] Git repository initialized and synced with GitHub
- [x] Technology stack decisions finalized

## 🛠️ Chosen Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18 + TypeScript** 
- Reason: Most valuable for portfolio, enterprise standard, excellent Material-UI integration

### Styling Framework
- **Material-UI (MUI)**
- Reason: Professional look, excellent React integration, responsive design

### Data Storage
- **Frontend-only** with localStorage/IndexedDB
- Reason: Personal use only, no server complexity needed

### Build Tools & Package Manager
- **Vite + npm**
- Reason: Fast development, modern tooling, industry standard

### Target Platform
- **Responsive web application** (works on laptop/desktop)
- No mobile app requirements (decision made to avoid complexity)

## 🎯 Next Steps (To Do on MacBook)

### Immediate Setup (Session 1)
1. **Initialize React + Vite project**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Material-UI dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   npm install @mui/icons-material
   ```

3. **Setup development tools**
   ```bash
   npm install -D eslint prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   ```

4. **Create organized folder structure**

5. **Configure ESLint and Prettier**

### Feature Development (Later Sessions)
1. **Create base components and layouts**
2. **Implement user authentication (login/register) system**
3. **Design and implement main dashboard UI**
4. **Build income and expense tracking functionality**
5. **Add budget management features**
6. **Implement financial goal setting and tracking**
7. **Create reports and analytics**

## 🔧 Development Best Practices
- **Modular code structure** - Each component in its own file
- **TypeScript for type safety** - Strict typing throughout
- **Component composition** - Reusable, composable components
- **Custom hooks** - Extract business logic into custom hooks
- **Consistent naming** - PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Automated code formatting and linting

## 📋 Key Features to Implement
1. **User Authentication**
   - Login/Register forms
   - Session management with localStorage

2. **Dashboard**
   - Financial overview cards
   - Recent transactions
   - Budget status
   - Goal progress

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Add/edit/delete income and expenses
   - Category management
   - Date filtering and search

4. **Budget Management**
   - Set monthly/yearly budgets by category
   - Budget vs actual spending visualization

5. **Financial Goals**
   - Set savings goals
   - Track progress
   - Goal achievement notifications

6. **Reports & Analytics**
   - Spending trends over time
   - Category breakdown charts
   - Export functionality

## 🚀 When Ready to Continue
1. Open this project folder on your MacBook
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed (use `node --version` to check)
3. Reference this guide for the next steps
4. The GitHub repo is ready to clone if needed

## 📝 Notes
- All data will be stored locally (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- Designed for single-user personal use
- Focus on clean, professional UI using Material Design
- Code structure optimized for maintainability and scalability
